## Exercises
The school has hired you to create their new database. They have provided you with a series of tasks to complete. Please follow each task in order.

### Exercise One
Your first task is to learn how to create and add new students to the database. For this task, you need to create a new student named "Linus Torvalds," who is 54 years old. Once you've added the student, read the student's information from the database and print it using the following format:
- "The student's name is STUDENT_NAME and they are STUDENT_AGE years old."

### Exercise Two
Now that you know how to add students to the database, your next task is to update existing student records. The school wants you to correct change the name of "Linus Torvalds" to "Steve Jobs" in the database.

After updating the record, retrieve the updated student information from the database and print it out using the following format:
- "The updated student's name is STUDENT_NAME and they are STUDENT_AGE years old."

### Exercise Three
Now that you have learned how to create and update records in the database, your next task is to delete a student record.

The school has decided to remove the student "Steve Jobs" from the database.
Your task is to find the student by name and delete their record from the database.

After deleting the student, retrieve all remaining student records from the database.
Print each studentâ€™s information using the following format:
- "Name: STUDENT_NAME, Age: STUDENT_AGE"

### Exercise Four
Now that you've mastered creating, updating, and deleting records, your next task is to create a new table & entity for courses.

Create a Course Entity / Table:
Define a new table named Course with the following columns:
id: An integer that serves as the primary key.
name: A string that represents the name of the course.

Add Sample Courses:
Add two courses to the table:
- "Computer Science 101"
- "History 201"

Retrieve and Print All Courses:
Query the database to retrieve all courses.
Print out each course using the following format:
- "Course ID: COURSE_ID, Course Name: COURSE_NAME"

Instructions:
- Look at the existing code in the repository for guidance on how to define tables / entities and work with the ORM.
- You do not need to manually create the tables in the database. Focus on defining the Python entities, and the ORM will automatically create the corresponding tables in the database for you.

### Exercise Five
Now that you have created the Course table, your next task is to establish a many-to-many relationship between students and courses. This will allow a student to be enrolled in multiple courses, and a course to have multiple students.

Establish a Many-to-Many Relationship:
Define a relationship between the Student and Course tables.
You will need to create an association table that links students to courses. This table will typically have at least two columns:
- student_id: A foreign key referencing the id of the Student table.
- course_id: A foreign key referencing the id of the Course table.

Modify the Student and Course Entities:
Update the Student and Course entities to include the relationship using the ORM's relationship functionality.

Add Sample Data:
- Enroll "Linus Torvalds" in "Computer Science 101".
- Enroll another student in "History 201".

Retrieve and Print Enrollments:
Query the database to retrieve all courses each student is enrolled in.
Print the results using the following format:
- "STUDENT_NAME is enrolled in COURSE_NAME."
